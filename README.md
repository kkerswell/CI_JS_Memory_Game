## Design

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with to be exciting and vibrant to set the users expectation for a fun game. There is not a large amount of content on the page as the focus is on the game itself. Due to this, the site was going to be on one page but with sections that the user can navigate through easily.
   
### Colour Scheme
- Create a fun and vibrant colour scheme
- The site will use six colours but four of these make up the background of the page.
- Final palette colours that were chosen were #ff7f00, #00819f, #d9005f, #4da100, #f4f7f5 and #24343f.

### Fonts
- Create a fun look with soft lines
- Final font chosen was Montserrat Alternates by Google Fonts
- Source: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=Montserrat+Alternates
- Additional font used to get the numbering effect in the 'Instructions' section.
- Source: https://www.fontspace.com/digits-font-f2006

### Images and Video
- For the project, royalty free imagry is required
- Image sources
  - Main Logo - https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/head-profile-with-gears_4347647.htm?query=brain%20icon
  - Back of Card Icons: https://seeklogo.com/vector-logo/319158/brain-shape
  - Front of Card Icons: https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/4213194-matching-pairs-geometry-game-memory-training-circle-triangle-square-tile-on-pink-teal-yellow-white-background
  - 404 Error - https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/oops-404-error-with-broken-robot-concept-illustration_13315300.htm

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognisable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. 
    
Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar and footer bar. 
    
The website consists of one page with four sections plus an additional full-screen modal for the game: 
- A main area consisting of the site logo, name and catchphrases.
- An instructions area where the users learn how to play the game.
- A game section which has a button to launch the game in a new modal.
- A contact section with a contact form.

## Problems

- Adding new levels to the game.  I tried researching online how I could to this.  However, as this was code used from a tutorial I saw, this was difficult. I had to resort to asking for tutor support and got the right idea from the second tutor. I was also then able to make more significant changes such as changing the difficulties by lowering the time.
- Making the game area fully responsive. This was difficult as I was working with new CSS featurs that I hadn't used before. I tried using bootstrap but this did not fix the issue. I had to resort to asking for tutor support and after talking it through with them, I was able to solve part of the issue myself but took their advice onboard for adding media queries as well.
- I wanted to add a feature where, depending on which section of the page the user was currently in, the navbar items at the top of the page would have an indicator on them.  I used JS to achieve this and had various levels of success but ultimately could not get it to function as I wanted.  Given the page is easy to navigate and not much time would be spent by the user on the page itself (as opposed to being within the game area) I felt it was not worth the time investment to troubleshoot this feature further and so removed it entirely.
- When the user is playing a game, if they click exit then a confirmation box will pop up asking them to confirm exit. I was unable to pause the game countdown whilst this box was active.
