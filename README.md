## Design

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed with to be exciting and vibrant to set the users expectation for a fun game. There is not a large amount of content on the page as the focus is on the game itself. Due to this, the site was going to be on one page but with sections that the user can navigate through easily.
   
### Colour Scheme
- Create a fun and vibrant colour scheme
- The site will use six colours but four of these make up the background of the page.
- Final palette colours that were chosen were #ff7f00, #00819f, #d9005f, #4da100, #f4f7f5 and #24343f.

### Fonts
- Create a fun look with soft lines
- Final font chosen was Montserrat Alternates by Google Fonts
- Source: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=Montserrat+Alternates
- Additional font used to get the numbering effect in the 'Instructions' section.
- Source: https://www.fontspace.com/digits-font-f2006

### Images and Video
- For the project, royalty free imagry is required
- Image sources
  - Main Logo - https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/head-profile-with-gears_4347647.htm?query=brain%20icon

  - 404 Error - https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/oops-404-error-with-broken-robot-concept-illustration_13315300.htm

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognisable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. 
    
Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar and footer bar. 
    
The website consists of one page with four sections plus an additional full-screen modal for the game: 
- A main area consisting of the site logo, name and catchphrases.
- An instructions area where the users learn how to play the game.
- A game section which has a button to launch the game in a new modal.
- A contact section with a contact form.

### Accessibility

https://wave.webaim.org/ was used to test accessibility.

The results were as follows:

<details><summary>Picture</summary>
<img src="docs/accessibility/accessibility.jpg">
</details><br>

Errors and rationale:

- 1 x No heading structure
  - As the page is very simple, this structuring is not required.

- 6 x Possible heading
  - Not required as adding these would not improve the document structure, outlines, and navigation.

- 2 x Empty form label
  - This has been identified on the checkboxes used for the volume control within the game. Therefore, an expected error.

- 1 x Broken ARIA reference
  - This has been picked up on the modal. It is not a concern as this is provided by Bootstrap.

## Problems

- spacing the a links in the nav bar.  I originally tried to add margin and padding but this was having an undesired effect.  I got arround this by adding line-height to the nav a section.
- When Adding a h1 to the header, the alignment of both h1 and nav changed to an undesired style. I struggled to get the h1 to align left and the nav to align right.  I then changed both to display inline but the nav was then aligned right next to the h1 on the right side of the page, when I wanted it on the left. I overcame this by adding float right to the nav.
- When hosting page on GitHub pages, the site did not work correctly.  I had to change all file paths to relative in order for this to work.
- On the index page, I wanted a large full-scale image to cover the screen with a text overlay.  Whilst I managed to achieve this, I found I experienced issues when it came to responsive design. I attempted several fixes but ultimately I decided to change the design of the page to allow for easier coding and responsiveness.
- When trying to style the images in the animal_hero div on the About Us page, I had an issue where the cat image was being pushed off the side of the page. I had to utilise Bootstrap in order to get the styling I wanted for this.
